00:00.060 --> 00:03.160
This is a follow-up to give you five more

00:03.160 --> 00:06.820
so let's not waste time and get right to it here we go with

00:06.820 --> 00:11.810
number one so this first mistake is common because in many languages when you

00:11.810 --> 00:15.330
discuss jobs where your station in life you don't use

00:15.330 --> 00:20.190
articles even if you come from a country where there are articles in the language so,

00:20.190 --> 00:24.880
for example, I am student he is engineer if I ask you

00:24.880 --> 00:29.770
what do you do you need to use an article because student is 

00:29.770 --> 00:34.740
accountable it's singular engineer is accountable and it's singular so you have to

00:34.740 --> 00:39.430
say I am a student he is an

00:39.430 --> 00:43.770
engineer now let's move onto number two 

00:43.770 --> 00:47.870
okay here we have to sentences on the board we have I

00:47.870 --> 00:52.660
am agree are you agree so in this situation

00:52.660 --> 00:57.310
agree is a verb we don't say im agree you can just say

00:57.310 --> 01:02.230
I agree if you if it's negative I don't agree or I disagree.
