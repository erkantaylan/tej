So, when you compare to 

00:01.960 --> 00:06.960
things when you're comparing apples and oranges

00:06.960 --> 00:10.470
...are some similarities...both fruits when?

00:10.470 --> 00:13.750
You're comparing shopping to scheme.

00:13.750 --> 00:17.240
When you're comparing a city to a country?

00:17.240 --> 00:18.040
Or the countryside.

00:19.180 --> 00:21.160
There's certain language we like to use

00:21.160 --> 00:25.520
...saying how are these things similar or the same.

00:25.520 --> 00:30.250
In this video I'm going to teach you a bunch of expressions you can use when

00:30.250 --> 00:34.640
comparing two things to show their similarities ok so this

00:34.640 --> 00:37.930
video is called talking about similarities.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.540
So, for this video I decided I wanted to do and

00:43.540 --> 00:46.780
theme I wanted to look at how 

00:46.780 --> 00:49.410
canada and england.

00:50.750 --> 00:54.090
Are similar in what ways are they very much

00:55.140 --> 00:59.520
...so each of my sentences are going to have to do with canada and england?
