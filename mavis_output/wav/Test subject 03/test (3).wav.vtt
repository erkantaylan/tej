00:05.440 --> 00:10.440
I just I taught myself how to programs...the can understand how the city works I want to

00:10.440 --> 00:16.360
visualize am I want to see them I want to play with them I was inspired by new york city

00:16.360 --> 00:21.080

00:21.080 --> 00:25.370
you have taxicabs ambulances fire trucks and they're always reporting

00:25.370 --> 00:29.010
where they are and what they're doing and if you can visualize

00:29.010 --> 00:33.010
...you can actually see how the city is living and breathing and what's happening in

00:33.010 --> 00:37.820
the city so I started building dispatch software and that's

00:37.820 --> 00:42.240
a software that runs these entities...reporting where they are what they're doing I'm

00:42.240 --> 00:47.230
ambulance it fits...broadway and taking a patient in cardiac arrest to saint john's

00:47.230 --> 00:51.600

00:51.600 --> 00:56.420
beautiful picture of all these verticals in the city that make the city work but 

00:56.420 --> 01:00.780
