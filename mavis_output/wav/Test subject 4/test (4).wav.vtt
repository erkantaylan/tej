My name's charles adler animate co-founder of kick-start in a setting the genesis of the

00:05.280 --> 00:10.700
platform starts with...back in twenty-one when he was trying to

00:10.700 --> 00:15.390
...event his main ambition was of sharing this music and

00:15.390 --> 00:20.840
in this cultural event with community in around norman's and,

00:20.840 --> 00:25.170
missing component was the funding to get the thing off the

00:25.170 --> 00:26.420
ground.

00:26.420 --> 00:30.940
The...eventually became the thing that solve that problem...the heart of

00:30.940 --> 00:34.980
that is still...sort of beating today which is effectively getting all

00:34.980 --> 00:40.700
these projects that are pet projects for people creative projects.

00:40.700 --> 00:45.390
Into culture...in some bring back that sort of creative spirit that 

00:45.390 --> 00:49.580
creative independence back into what we see every day like region

00:49.580 --> 00:51.420
...contribute to world.

00:51.420 --> 00:56.280
And, I think, you know, that's one thing that kept us going in every everything we're looking at, you know,

00:56.280 --> 01:01.190
some competitor popping up before we launched...of potential distraction.
