Andrew us ask a question which strikes fear in the...

00:03.520 --> 00:08.490
of every programmer and that is first of all moore's law which is hell

00:08.490 --> 00:13.400
for fifty years which says that computer our doubles every eighteen months may begin to

00:13.400 --> 00:18.640
expire in the next ten so years in other whereas if you knew that

00:18.640 --> 00:22.610
at christmas time you computer...as powerful as the

00:22.610 --> 00:26.220
last christmas present would you buy a computer

00:26.220 --> 00:31.180
would you upgrade most people...say no why should I...computer if 

00:31.180 --> 00:35.130
it's identical to flashers model well that could create

00:35.130 --> 00:39.390
a planetary recession planetary depression knowing

00:39.390 --> 00:44.170
that this engine of prosperity the computer revolution is running out of

00:44.170 --> 00:48.040
stain but that's just the way it is last month, for example,

00:48.040 --> 00:53.360
I spoke in zurich switzerland I met with a physicist at zurich ibm

00:53.360 --> 00:58.260
...leading institutions and they told me that,...they could see it now it's

00:58.260 --> 01:00.930
not and science-fiction is done the future.
