I would like to know-how hard it is the mathematics part of computer science undergraduate

00:05.190 --> 00:07.610
course love computers...and,

00:07.610 --> 00:10.820
would love to know how to code understand the operating systems

00:10.820 --> 00:15.560
...a technical way to maybe some day work for some big company but I'm worried about using the course because

00:15.560 --> 00:19.550
...mathematics part because I'm not very good at it do you think the teachers do a good

00:19.550 --> 00:24.510
job explaining what you have to do or do you have to learn most...stuff by yourself because if that's the case

00:24.510 --> 00:29.970
I guess it's too hard for me what are your thoughts computer science?

00:29.970 --> 00:33.470
Data...yeah,

00:33.470 --> 00:37.280
I don't know what why is it's so funny like they're.

00:37.280 --> 00:41.450
People just blind to certain things and like the technology world people are

00:41.450 --> 00:46.130
does blind to things and it's so funny because like people say...want

00:46.130 --> 00:49.480
...computer science degree...think I need to know math

00:50.650 --> 00:54.110
...the to words what the to words

00:54.110 --> 00:59.040
...computer science delight well computer layout 

00:59.040 --> 01:01.400
what's the other word computer.
